# 7 Data Science

Use https://www.obviously.ai/ to analyze prices of avocados based on historic prices and 4 other featuers. It trains a prediction model and returns feature importance (not future prices?)

# 9 Website design

Use https://www.figma.com/ to design a website (think photoshop / inkscape).

- export to CSS (?! didn't see that)
- many plugins, see https://uxplanet.org/10-ai-figma-plugins-every-ui-ux-designer-must-try-d71a9acff1e
- likely a lot more, because company valued at 20 bio USD !
- also offers FigJam, which is even more (?) collaborative

NOTES:

- Similar tool for only wireframes is https://moqups.com/ , but free version is more limited apparently.
- Find completley free, commercially usable images on https://unsplash.com/ (money through ads, photographes use it as portfolio)

# 10 One-page website with HTML and CSS

Use https://carrd.co/ to create a simple one-webpage website with a form that signs you up using https://www.mailerlite.com/ .

- publishes directly to a website (xxx.card.co or custom domain (PRO))
- really nice responsive design working on all devices
- does it have dynamic elements? -> No, only forms
- great free plan: 3 sites per account

- connect site to https://www.memberspace.com/ to make one page member-only and allow member sign-up
